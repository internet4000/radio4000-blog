Today version 3.1.1 of [Radio4000](http://radio4000.com) is out!

When have included a bunch of new features, here is a small list:

-   **URL have changed!** Find your channel directly at
    **radio.com/yourRadio** instead of radio4000.com/c/yourRadio. Easier
    to remember, more logic but remember to update the links pointing to
    your radio. 
-   There is now a big **Play button** on every radio to listen to it
    straight when you open it.
-   You can now see when a radio was **last updated**. So each time a
    music is added to a radio it refreshes its "last updated" date.
-   On the discover page "**All Radios**" now have the card styles, that
    means **more space for images** instead of list as a default
    display.
-   The **Bookmarklet** has been improved so now it does not close the
    youtube video you were currently listening to
-   ... also some other small bug fixes, clearer text and contextual
    informations to ease your use of r4!

Hope you like those improvements!
