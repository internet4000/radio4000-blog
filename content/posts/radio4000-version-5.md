Good evening!

Tonight [Radio4000](https://radio4000.com/) gets updated to a new major
version
([github\#v.5.0.0](https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000/tree/production)).
We're happy to introduce some new features, and an effort to harmonize
the overall experience across the software.

It is coming in with a new **radio channel homepage** and a new design
now including the latest 10 tracks. A new subpage therefore appears
under your radio, **/tracks**. This choice aims to help improve loading
performances, and usability such as easing the experience of adding a
new track to one's radio.\
We also hope in close future to add insights on these amazing lists to
help you understand what it contains, how to dig it, and how it can be
organized.

Managing your favorite radio channels also becomes more fluid, giving
the opportunity to interact in a more organic way while discovering and
exploring other people's selection.

We're supper excited about the times ahead, improvements are coming
strong.

[Your feedback is always very much
appreciated](https://radio4000.com/feedback), so don't hesitate writing
us a line or two, anything on your mind.
