Time flies and so does our new copy on the website. It should be clearer
what everything is now. Following along that, you will see that channel
descriptions are now everywhere, on a channel detail or on its card ---
tell there what your channel is about.

We also streamlined the header and player design while preparing for the
Ember 2.0 update which should make everything leaner.

Oh, and we added a cheesy loading screen in fifty shades of languages.

Last, here's a track for you to
enjoyÂ <http://radio4000.com/good-time-radio/-JqJ9SmQmO_DQx0bmv0k>

Cheers
