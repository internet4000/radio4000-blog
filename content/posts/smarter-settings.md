We've unified your Radio4000 settings. Now there's a single location at [radio4000.com/settings](https://radio4000.com/settings), where you can customize your radio, add it to the global Radio4000 map, make a backup or manage your account.

Before this update, settings were split between `/auth/settings` and `/{channel-slug}/edit`. Now, both will redirect to /settings.

If you are interested in the code changes, check the [pull request #226](https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000/pull/226).

And as always, please send feedback on https://radio4000.com/feedback. Enjoy!
