title: Use Radio4000.com on mobile devices
---

Since the beginning of the project Radio4000 has been thought,
designed and coded to work well on every devices, operating systems
and browsers.

One long time issue was using Radio4000 on mobile devices, because
until now it was not possible to play a Radio4000 radio and lock the
device's screen.

This is now solved!

# How to play Radio4000 with the mobile phone screen locked

The solution is pretty simple, but will work only for **Android and on
Firefox**. If you're not using Mozilla's Firefox browser, you should
definitely start now as it is a browser that respects your privacy,
meaning it does not track everyting you do to show you advertising.

Here are the steps:

1. [Download the latest version of
   Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/products/firefox) for android
   devices
2. Install the firefox addon [Video Background Play
   Fix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-background-play-fix/). As
   its name suggests, this addon (developped by Timothy Chien, a
   Software Engineer at Mozilla Firefox) will now allow videos to be
   played in the background of your device.
3. Now, you can play videos from [radio400.com](https://radio4000.com)
   and [youtube.com](https://youtube.com), and at the same time use
   your mobile device like you usually do, switching applications,
   windows or tabs; the video will continue playing until you stop it.

# Known limitations

This solution is really helpful as it solves a long time issue from
using R4 on mobile. There are still some caveats that we will continue
to try and solve.

- for some yet unkown reasons, sometimes the next video does not
  automatically plays. Just unlock your screen and the video should
  automatically start playing, you can lock your screen back, and this
  bug should not happen again during this session.

- this addon is not available for iOS, so iPhones and iPods won't be
  able to use it.

# Some context

This the beginning of the project, Radio4000 has been thought, design
and build to work well on every device, operating system and
web-browser. This is the reason why there are no "native" mobile
applications for Android ar iOs, because they both require new
projects, and cannot reuse the code the is written for the web
version.

Radio4000 decided to bet on web technologies, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.
All are included in every web browsers, and there are web browsers
running on every devices.

If you are interested in the code that makes Radio4000 possible, you
can explore it on [Github](https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000).
Also, don't hesitate to join the discussion about the projects on the
[community chat](http://chat.radio4000.com).

Good day!
