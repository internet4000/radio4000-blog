Radio4000 updates to version 3.3! What’s new?In order to explore radios faster, we’ve added a “play ‘n shuffle” button on the radio channel cards. Try it, tap it as many times as you like, we think it makes listening much more fun. Your favorite radios are taking the place of the “most popular radios” section directly on the homepage.We’ve also started implementing a new design for radios, further innovations can be expected in the upcoming versions.HTTPS protocol comes in to improve security of communications between your devices and Radio4000 (Note: we recommend you to use this browser extension, https everywhere, that forces https on every site you visit).Finally, one small but useful change; to share the current track being played, copy its link from the player bar at the bottom.We’re already working on the next version for Radio4000, you can expect non-intrusive notifications to let you know when radios you like have added new tracks.One last keyword, customization.Have a good week, maybe this track from last week’s featured radio, Sugar Hiccup, can help shape it.
