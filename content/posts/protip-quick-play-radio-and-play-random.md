Hello there,

just wanted to share with you **two good tips to start listening to a
radio as fast as possible**.\
\
Let's take a radio, could be yours, could be anyone else's, let's
say **balls**, [radio4000.com/balls](https://radio4000.com/balls), hi
balls!\
\
When you want to play this radio
on [radio4000.com](https://radio4000.com), you will probably type the
address of radio4000 in your web browser, then visit the radio page
before finally hitting the play button or a track on the chosen radio.\

That's cool and pretty quick, but now there is a faster way, taking the
form of a URL shortcut. Let me show you, it is very straight forward.

> **[radio4000.com/balls/play](https://radio4000.com/balls/play)\
> [radio4000.com/balls/play/random ](https://radio4000.com/balls/play/random)**
>
> The first link will just play the latest track from "balls" radio.\
> The second link will play a random track from the same radio.

Note 1: remember it works for any radio, but you of course have to know
the radio URL (radio4000.com/balls, the part after the "/"). \

Note 2: to find what is your radio URL, visit your radio on
[radio4000.com](https://radio4000.com) and look at address in your
browser. [You can edit it by going to the edit page or your
radio](https://support.internet4000.com/radio4000/#how-do-i-change-the-url-of-my-radio).
