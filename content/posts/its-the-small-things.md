A new update is out on [Radio4000](https://radio4000.com/bookmarklet)
--- it's now faster to add a track to your radio. Whereas before you'd
have to go to your radio and first then tap add track, now you can add
directly from anywhere on Radio4000.

If you're not already using the
[bookmarklet](https://radio4000.com/bookmarklet), you should try it out.
After you've saved the bookmarklet it's only two-taps to add a track
while you're browsing YouTube.
