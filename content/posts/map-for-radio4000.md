There is a new way to discover Radio4000 channels online, [a map of the
world](https://radio4000.com/map).

As of today **everyone can position their Radio4000 channel to one
location in the world**. So can you!

There are **no restriction, nor any obligation**. As always **freedom
first**. You only decide if and where you would like your channel to
appear on the map; where your body resides or your heart belongs, it is
and will remain your choice.

If you decide to locate your radio on the world map, you can of course
remove or change your position at any time, and this information will
appear on your [Radio4000 channel
page](https://radio4000.com/artisanal-cheeseburgers), under your channel
title.

This map could not exist without the help
of [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/about) and of course
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) and their
contributors, who both provide the data, expertise and geomatics skills
for such projects to exists. We will be forever grateful that you're
making such projects available, thank you.

We chose this particular [map
tiles](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles) for many reasons, to
name a few:

-   **Language localisation**, so for every region of the world, every
    places will be represented with the local [written
    system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system). Zoom
    in [Europe](https://radio4000.com/map?lat=49.25346477497736&lng=7.053222656250001&zoom=5), [Russia](https://radio4000.com/map?lat=55.606281251302114&lng=50.3448486328125&zoom=7),
     [Est-Asia](https://radio4000.com/map?lat=37.84015683604136&lng=121.75048828125001&zoom=5),
    you'll quickly see.
-   This is a [**topographic
    map**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map),
    using [contour lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) to
    show elevations, valleys and hills, steepness or gentleness of
    slopes.
-   **Gorgeous colors and contrasts**.\

Overall this map is aimed to help all of us **discover more music**
and maybe appreciate in a **geographical context** choices made by the
individuals whose personalities make curating a Radio so special.

We hope you will like it as much as we do.
